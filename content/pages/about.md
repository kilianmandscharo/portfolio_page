title: About

My name is Dominik Heller. I like writing software with a
main interest in front-end web development.

During the second semester of my Media Studies master&apos;s
program at the University of Regensburg I learned the basics
of HTML and CSS. Simultaneously approaching digital
computers from a theoretical perspective, learning about
their fundamental workings, early history and present as
well as future potential in the form of AI, kindled my
interest in programming even more. Thus it so happened, that
in the following semesters I took classes for programming in
C and Python, for data analysis and visualization, and
taught myself JavaScript and React. At the end of this
period, and therefore once again intertwining the practical
and theoretical, I earned a master&apos;s degree with a
thesis about learning machines, mostly focusing on the
history of Cybernetics and Deep Learning.

In this time and since then I have finished a few projects,
some of which I want to display on this page.
